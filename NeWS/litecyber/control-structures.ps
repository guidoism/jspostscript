% Purpose: Control structures with local state, that is not available to 
% the code being executed (i.e. the control structure dict is not on the
% top of the dict stack, getting in the way).

systemdict begin

% like repeat but leaves count on stack
/repeat-for { % n proc => ...
  10 dict begin % scope
    /proc exch def
    /n exch def
    /i 0 def
    % think of this as a closure over this scope
    [ currentdict
      { begin
          i n ge { end exit } if
	  i /i i 1 add def
	  /proc load
	end
	exec % execute proc outside of scope
      } aload pop
    ] cvx % closure
  end % of scope
  loop % execute it till it exits
} def
